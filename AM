Additive Manufacturing using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)

This project focuses on the design, process analysis, and optimization of components fabricated using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology. It covers powder-bed fusion principles, thermal behavior during laser sintering, material characterization (primarily polymer powders), and parameter optimization including laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing, and layer thickness.

The study evaluates dimensional accuracy, surface finish, mechanical strength, and build orientation effects. CAD models were designed and prepared for slicing, followed by process simulation and post-processing analysis.

Objective: Improve part integrity, reduce warpage, and enhance mechanical performance through controlled process parameter optimization in SLS-based additive manufacturing.
